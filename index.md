Hi, I'm Nav! I'm a senior at NYU studying Data Science & Ethical Innovation Systems. 

I'm originally from Chandler, Arizona and currently reside in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. 

I am on the board of the [Albert Gallatin Founders Fund](https://forms.gallatin.nyu.edu/node/782), NYU's student-run venture fund. I am currently a [Consumer Lending Intern](https://www.wellsfargojobs.com/en/early-careers/undergraduate-programs/consumer-lending/) at Wells Fargo, working on **Product, Analytics, & Digital Innovation** within [Auto](https://www.wellsfargo.com/auto-loans/).

Previously, I worked in research at the **NYU Grossman School of Medicine**, within the [Health Evaluation & Analytics Lab](https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/health-behavior/section-health-choice-policy-evaluation/research/health-evaluation-analytics-lab). 

I'm super passionate about roles that involve utilizing data to solve complex problems within different industries, whether it be enterprise-level or public sector oriented.
