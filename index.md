Hi, I'm Nav! I graduated from NYU with my BA last December. 

I grew up in Chandler, Arizona and now reside in Manhattan.

This Spring, I'll be working at the [Council for Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/) as a Product Management Intern. 

This past summer, I worked as an analyst at Wells Fargo, specifically on **Product, Analytics, & Digital Innovation** within [Auto](https://www.wellsfargo.com/auto-loans/).

At NYU, I served on the board of the [Albert Gallatin Founders Fund](https://forms.gallatin.nyu.edu/node/782), NYU's student-run venture fund. I also conducted research at [NYU Stern](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/academic-departments/tops) and the [NYU Grossman School of Medicine](https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/health-behavior/section-health-choice-policy-evaluation/research/health-evaluation-analytics-lab).
