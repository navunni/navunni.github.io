Hi, I'm Nav! I recently graduated from NYU with my BA in last December. 

I grew up in Chandler, Arizona and currently reside in Manhattan.

For the Spring, I'll be working at the think-tank [Council for Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/) as a Product Management Intern. 

I am on the board of the [Albert Gallatin Founders Fund](https://forms.gallatin.nyu.edu/node/782), NYU's student-run venture fund. This past summer, I worked as an analyst at Wells Fargo, specifically on **Product, Analytics, & Digital Innovation** within [Auto](https://www.wellsfargo.com/auto-loans/).

Previously, I worked in research at the **NYU Stern School of Business**, focusing on **platform governance & intellectual property rights within streaming services**.
