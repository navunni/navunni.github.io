Hi, I'm Nav! I'm a senior at NYU studying Data Science & Ethical Innovation Systems. 

I grew up in Chandler, Arizona and currently reside in Manhattan.

Currently, I'm conducting research at the [**NYU Stern School of Business**](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/academic-departments/tops), focusing on **platform governance & intellectual property rights within streaming services**. 

I am on the board of the [Albert Gallatin Founders Fund](https://forms.gallatin.nyu.edu/node/782), NYU's student-run venture fund. This past summer, I worked as an analyst at Wells Fargo, specifically on **Product, Analytics, & Digital Innovation** within [Auto](https://www.wellsfargo.com/auto-loans/).

Previously, I worked in research at the **NYU Grossman School of Medicine**, within the [Health Evaluation & Analytics Lab](https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/health-behavior/section-health-choice-policy-evaluation/research/health-evaluation-analytics-lab).
