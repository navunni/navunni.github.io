Hi, I'm Nav! I'm a senior at NYU studying Data Science & Ethical Innovation Systems. 

I'm originally from Chandler, Arizona and currently reside in the Financial District, NY. 

I am on the board of the [Albert Gallatin Founders Fund](https://forms.gallatin.nyu.edu/node/782), NYU's student-run venture fund. This past summer, I worked as an analyst at Wells Fargo, specifically on **Product, Analytics, & Digital Innovation** within [Auto](https://www.wellsfargo.com/auto-loans/).

Previously, I worked in research at the **NYU Grossman School of Medicine**, within the [Health Evaluation & Analytics Lab](https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/health-behavior/section-health-choice-policy-evaluation/research/health-evaluation-analytics-lab).  

I am currently working on intellectual property/copyright research at NYU Stern.
