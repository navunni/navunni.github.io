# Welcome!

Hello all! This will function as a blog for my website that I've revised and re-designed to look more cleaner and translucent. 

Right now, I'm in the midst of planning my senior project proposal and preparation for final exams. This is my penultimate semester of college, and it is tough to digest how fast time has passed since stepping foot into my freshman dorm for the first time. 

I'm not exactly sure how frequent I will be in terms of writing/posting on here, but I figured I'd rather jot down any spur-of-the-moment thoughts here rather on a Substack page/external outlet. I'm a big fan of Anil Dash's [blog](https://www.anildash.com/), and it's his writing and commentary that motivated to me to create my own individual page in the first page. 

I also plan on sharing my thoughts on music/art, what I've been listening to as of late, and who/which concerts I hope to listen to in the future. For now, that is all, but we'll see where this page ultimately goes, if anywhere.
