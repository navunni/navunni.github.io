# First Entry 

Hello all! This will function as a blog for my website that I've revised and re-designed to look more cleaner and translucent. My last website didn't have much other than a few projects and my resume, but now, I figure that I may as well starting writing some of my thoughts on here. 

Right now, I'm in the midst of planning my senior project proposal and preparation for final exams. This is my penultimate semester of college, and it is tough to digest how fast time has passed since stepping foot into my freshman dorm for the first time.
