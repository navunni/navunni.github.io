Hello world!

I haven't had too much time to write a blog entry in the last two weeks, primarily due to finals, of which I have 2 left. However, I wanted to share a final project that I submitted last week for my undergraduate data science class at NYU. This is the [source code](https://github.com/navunni/capstone-project/)

The class itself has been probably one of the best and most satisfying classes I've ever taken, over my time here. 

As for usual entries, I will get back on it next week once I'm done with the finals grind. 

Till next time.
