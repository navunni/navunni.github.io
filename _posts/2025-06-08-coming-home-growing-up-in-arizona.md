# Coming Home: Growing Up in Arizona
*Reflections about growing up in the Grand Canyon state, leaving for college, and somehow always ending up back in the desert (in the form of FAQs, of course).*

## Why even write this post? 

Because I realized that I've spent **every single summer since starting college back in Arizona.** And now I'm here again, albeit purposefully--with a full 3-month long internship. I always end up back here, and I have a lot of feelings about it!

## How many summers have you spent here? 

All of them. I'm **3/3** so far. 

- **Summer 2023** -> I worked for an SF startup and did research at NYU remotely. Concurrently, I spent lots of precious and fun time with my family. 
- **Summer 2024** -> Research went remote again; however, I spent two/three fun weeks in Scotch Plains, NJ and NYC visting one of my closest friends and helping NYU pre-college students successfully write their college essays (I really think I made their writing only *worse*).
- **Summer 2025** -> Got an internship and picked Chandler amongst the options of Charlotte, Des Moines, and Wilmington (even more ironic as two of my closest friends are from North Carolina and Delaware). Now I'm back in Arizona again, *fully by choice*.

## How did you end up with an internship back in Arizona? 

Honestly, **by sheer coincidence**. I applied to different internships all over, and first got a call back from Wells Fargo. I was fortunate enough to receive a written offer earlier than most, and got to choose my preferred site. Although I do love visiting home whenever I can, it's nice to have a more structured reason this time. 

## How are Arizona summers? 

They are **tough**. There's a specific kind of noon heat that feels like walking into an oven (my mom's *verbatim description* of **walking out of Sky Harbor airport for the first time, coming from West Lafayette, Indiana**). However, nothing really can beat the sunset. Looking over Catalina Foothills on a summer evening is an indescribable feeling. 

## What do you do when I get back? 

- **Frequent my favorite spots** - Highly recommend [Phuket Thai](https://www.visitchandler.com/listing/phuket-thai/768), [Joe's Farm Grill](https://www.joesfarmgrill.com/), or [The Dhaba](https://the-dhaba.com/) if you're in the Chandler/Tempe suburbs.
- **See friends from middle/high school** - the ones still here or back for summer. 
- **Try to make peace with the heat** - Haven't found 100% success with this one just yet. 

This is a general note, but there a few things that have suprised me about Phoenix, since the time I've been gone. 

For one, the city has a considerably large, vibrant downtown scene. Additionally, there are lots of great *local* **coffee shops** I somehow never noticed before. 

## What advice would you give to college students coming to Arizona for the summer? 

- **Embrace the weird beauty of it** - Arizona is not NYC, not SF, not Chicago -- it is it's own thing, and that's fine.
- **Find your AC "third-spots"** - coffee shops, libraries, the gym--whatever it may be, make sure it has AC!
- **Stay *hydrated* *** (yes, everyone says this, but actually follow this guideline!)
- **Appreciate your surroundings** - take an early-morning hike or a drive through the desert. The cactuses will outlive us all. Hell, *go to the Grand Canyon* if you haven't before, it is absolutely worth it.

Every year, I think "this is the last Arizona summer."

Every year, I'm back. And honestly? I'm okay with that.

Till next time.
