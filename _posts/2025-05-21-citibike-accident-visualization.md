# Open-Data Visualizations

Over the past day, I built a simple interactive map using public data to visualize accident locations in NYC.


The project started from a past homework assignment in my Data Management & Analysis class, where I used a large dataset from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) containing crash reports from 2020. After cleaning the data and filtering for valid borough and location values, I converted it into a GeoJSON format for the browser. 


I used [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) to render the map and display each accident as a colored dot. All the points on the map are color-coded by borough and can be clicked to see individual metadata. The entire site is built on plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”no external frameworks.


My main goal in building this visualization was to explore civic data in a visual, user-oriented way. I've previously worked with geospatial data and the Google Maps API as a research assistant at the NYU School of Medicine. Still, I wanted to build a standalone website (without logins/libraries) and practice working with such data through JavaScript.

Working with public data helped me think more about how we present existing information. A "simple map" still consists of thousands of data points (~70,000).


I plan to do more short visual projects like this using NYC datasets and civic information APIs. It's a shame Google shut down its Civic Information API last month.

Till next time.
